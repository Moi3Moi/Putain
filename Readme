[PUTAIN - About]
	This is a brainfuck interpreter, probably the fastest one due to
	the way it is implmented since it avoids the use of stack, instead
	uses registers as much as it can. This is a pretty good project to
	give x86 a try!

[PUTAIN - Usage]
	% make
	% puta [filename]

	if [filename] does not exist or it causes any error the puta will
	tell you :)
